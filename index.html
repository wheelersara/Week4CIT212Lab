    <header> 
    <h1>The header is static because there was no postining added! 
        If no positioning is added, it remains in a default state. </h1>
    </header>

    <nav>
    <p> The nav bar is in fixed position, and will conform to the 
        top and left parameters it is set to. When scrolling it will stay in place.
        If elements are placed above, below, next to, etc. it will stay in its assigned location.

    <div>

        <div class="articles">

            <article>This article is in relative position, therefore it 
                will stay in place when scrolling on the webpage and inserting
                content will cause it to be flexible to other objects.
            </article>

            <article>
                This article has the same parameters as the article above!
            </article>

        </div>

    <aside>
        The aside box is placed in absolute postition. This means that the box
        accomodates the content that comes before it. It will move, in this case 
        to the side, with the rest of the content on the page.
    </aside>

    </div>

    <footer>
        The footer is similar in nature to the nav bar. It is in fixed position and 
        will adhere to the bottom of the page because it is set to bottom positioning. 
    </footer>
